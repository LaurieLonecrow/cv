This is a practice CV I created from a tutorial.  It can be viewed at https://laurielonecrow.github.io/cv/

This was the very first web page that I built using html and css and then posted to Github.  I've looked back at it a number of times just to keep perspective that I have learned a lot from where I began.  I don't plan on editing any of the terrible looking structure or markup, so don't judge me!  Let's just appreciate that we all have to start at the bottom in order to go up from there...
